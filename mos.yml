# Custom configuration entries, settable via "device configuration"
# Below is a custom firmware configuration example.
# Uncomment and modify according to your needs:

config_schema:
  - ["app", "o", {title: "IntelliPot app custom settings"}]
  - ["app.output.led", "i", 2, {title: "Internal MCU led"}]
  - ["wifi.sta_connect_timeout", "i", 5, {title: "Timeout for connection, seconds"}]
  - ["wifi.ap.ssid", "s", "IntelliPot_??????", {title: "SSID"}]
  - ["wifi.ap.pass", "s", "IntelliPot", {title: "Password", type: "password"}]
  - ["wifi.ap.protocol", "s", "", {title: "AP Protocol"}]
  - ["wifi.sta.protocol", "s", "", {title: "STA Protocol"}]
  - ["dash.enable", "b", true, {title: "Dashboard enable"}]
  - ["dash.token", "s", "C116VIO8dBeESMcBxGdWkg", {title: "Dashboard token"}]

# These settings get compiled into the C structure, and can be accessed
# from the C code this way:
#
# printf("Hello from %s!\n", mgos_sys_config_get_device_id());
#
# Settings are cool: can be modified remotely without full firmware upgrade!
#
# To see all available compiled settings, buid the firmware and open
# build/gen/mgos_config.h file.
#
# Also, in this config_schema section, you can override existing
# settings that has been created by other libraries. For example, debug log
# level is 2 by default. For this firmware we can override it to 3:
#
# config_schema:
#  - ["debug.level", 3]
